Scripts that I personally developed and use. Feel free to use/modify as you see fit.

### Descriptions:

- ```batch_file_downloader.sh```: automatically downloads a list of HTTP links from a file

- ```get_file_extension.sh```: gets file extension from input file

- ```gitundo.sh``` (and its executable, ```gitundo```): undoes a certain number of git commits

- ```gits.py``` (and its linux executable, ```gits```): can propagate a git command to all git repositories in a directory

**Templates**:
    * ```template.sh```: bash script template
    * ```template.py```: python script template
